# Kuramoto-model-analysis
Study of synchronization of coupled phase oscillators following the Kuramoto model (KM) on different underlying topologies, specifically on Erdős–Rényi (ER), Watts–Strogatz (WS) and Barabasi-Albert (BA) networks. The latter model is of particular interest because it aims to reproduce real networks with scale-free (SF) topology, since the degree distribution follows the power law $P(k) \sim k^{-3}$. 

Analysis of synchronization dynamics in complex networks with hierarchical organization of communities and how this process unravels its different topological scales.
